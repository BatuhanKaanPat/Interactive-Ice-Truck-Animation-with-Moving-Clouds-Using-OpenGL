  This project demonstrates an animated scene built using OpenGL and GLUT. The centerpiece is an ice-truck traveling along a road, accompanied by moving clouds in the background. The animation includes:

1.Dynamic Clouds: Three distinct clouds with individual speeds move across the screen, resetting their positions upon reaching the edge.
2.Controllable Truck: The truck can be moved left and right using the arrow keys, offering user interaction.
3.Start/Stop Animation: Animation of both the clouds and the truck's auto-movement can be toggled using the spacebar.
4.Scenic Background: A landscape with a road, road lines, and a colorful sky completes the scene.
5.Window Resizing: The viewport adapts to window resizing dynamically.
6.Visual Details: Includes additional aesthetic elements such as a frame, wallpaper stripes, and text descriptions.
  
  The project serves as a beginner-friendly example of combining 2D graphics and animation principles in OpenGL, showcasing features like polygon rendering, custom shapes (circles for clouds and wheels), and user input handling. It demonstrates how interactive and visually appealing programs can be created using OpenGL.
